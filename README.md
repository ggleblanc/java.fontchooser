Java Swing Font Chooser
-----------------------

I modeled my font chooser after the font chooser in Windows XP 
Notepad. I couldn’t do exactly what the Notepad developers did, 
since I was working within the limitations of Java. During some 
debugging, I noticed that the Java Font class had a bunch of 
private and private package fields that would have been helpful 
to my font chooser.

Here’s an image of the Notepad font chooser.

I originally wanted to make this Java font chooser a part of an 
editor that I’m working on. When I realized how large a project 
the font chooser was, I moved it into it’s own Java project.
